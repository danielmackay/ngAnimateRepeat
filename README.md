ngAnimateRepeat
===============

AngularJS animation sample using ngAnimate and animate.css for a ng-repeat.  Sliding animations are used when a member is added or removed from the list.  I also use a background animation to highlight new items in the list.

All the animations in this example are done solely via CSS.
